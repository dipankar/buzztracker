Buzztracker
============

This was a google talk bot that allows you to track tweets around a certain keyword that you have registered for.

Usage
-----

It should be easy to setup the database with the SQL files provided, or you can use the script

You would need 2 XMPP accounts
buzz@domain.com
feeder@domain.com

You will need to add one account to the other manually. After that you should be able to add buzz@domain.com and register for keywords you want tweets from.
Have not tested this lately, should still work.
